	abstract = {Balancing the distributions of the confounders across the exposure levels in an observational study through matching or weighting is an accepted method to control for confounding due to these variables when estimating the association between an exposure and outcome and to reduce the degree of dependence on certain modeling assumptions. Despite the increasing popularity in practice, these procedures cannot be immediately applied to datasets with missing values. Multiple imputation of the missing data is a popular approach to account for missing values while preserving the number of units in the dataset and accounting for the uncertainty in the missing values. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive matching and weighting software that can be easily implemented with multiply imputed datasets. In this paper, we review this problem and suggest a framework to map out the matching and weighting multiply imputed datasets to 5 actions as well as the best practices to assess balance in these datasets after matching and weighting. We also illustrate these approaches using a companion package for R, {MatchThem}.},

	abstract = {Objective: This paper is a resource for applied researchers and journal reviewers who wish to learn more about propensity score methods, especially recent published recommendations for selecting and balancing covariates before conducting treatment effect analysis. Method: We reviewed and synthesized methodological studies of propensity score analysis from multiple disciplines in an effort to distill a cogent and defensible set of recommendations for research practice. Results: Selection of covariates for propensity score methods requires good understanding of empirical evidence and theory related to confounders of treatment assignment and the outcome, as well as clarity about the temporal relations among confounders, treatment, and outcome as measured in the data set in use. Some variables are not appropriate for inclusion in a propensity score model, and some data sets do not include sufficient variables for propensity score analysis. Achieving balance in the model covariates after conditioning on the propensity score should be an iterative process where models are respecified until proper balance is obtained. Important steps for propensity score methods include reporting results from iterative modeling and balance checks, and then defending the final sample conditioned on the propensity score before analysis of treatment effects. These steps are often overlooked in published research. Conclusion: Propensity score methods can be useful tools for reducing bias due to observed confounders. To credibly reduce bias, however, researchers must execute recommended practice for selecting and balancing covariates.},

	abstract = {Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to estimate the effects of treatments and exposures when using observational data. The propensity score was initially developed for use with binary exposures (e.g., active treatment vs. control). The generalized propensity score is an extension of the propensity score for use with quantitative exposures (e.g., dose or quantity of medication, income, years of education). A crucial component of any propensity score analysis is that of balance assessment. This entails assessing the degree to which conditioning on the propensity score (via matching, weighting, or stratification) has balanced measured baseline covariates between exposure groups. Methods for balance assessment have been well described and are frequently implemented when using the propensity score with binary exposures. However, there is a paucity of information on how to assess baseline covariate balance when using the generalized propensity score. We describe how methods based on the standardized difference can be adapted for use with quantitative exposures when using the generalized propensity score. We also describe a method based on assessing the correlation between the quantitative exposure and each covariate in the sample when weighted using generalized propensity score -based weights. We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of these methods. We also compared two different methods of estimating the generalized propensity score: ordinary least squared regression and the covariate balancing propensity score method. We illustrate the application of these methods using data on patients hospitalized with a heart attack with the quantitative exposure being creatinine level.},

            In this article, we carefully examine two important implementation issues when estimating propensity scores using generalized boosted models ({GBM}), a promising machine learning technique. First, we examine which of the following methods for tuning {GBM} lead to better covariate balance and inferences about causal effects: pursuing covariate balance between the treatment groups or tuning the propensity score model on the basis of a model fit criterion. Second, we examine how well {GBM} can handle irrelevant covariates that are included in the estimation model. We find that chasing balance rather than model fit when estimating propensity scores yielded better covariate balance and more accurate treatment effect estimates. Additionally, we find that adding irrelevant covariates to {GBM} increased imbalance and bias in the treatment effects. The findings from this paper have useful implications for other work focused on improving methods for estimating propensity scores.},

            An important goal in causal inference is to achieve balance in the covariates among the treatment groups. In this article, we introduce the concept of distributional balance preserving which requires the distribution of the covariates to be the same in different treatment groups. We also introduce a new balance measure called kernel distance, which is the empirical estimate of the probability metric defined in the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Compared to the traditional balance metrics, the kernel distance measures the difference in the two multivariate distributions instead of the difference in the finite moments of the distributions. Simulation results show that the kernel distance is the best indicator of bias in the estimated casual effect compared to several commonly used balance measures. We then incorporate kernel distance into genetic matching, the state-of-the-art matching procedure and apply the proposed approach to analyze the Early Dieting in Girls study. The study indicates that mothers’ overall weight concern increases the likelihood of daughters’ early dieting behavior, but the causal effect is not significant.},

	abstract = {Observational studies often benefit from an abundance of observational units. This can lead to studies that -- while challenged by issues of internal validity -- have inferences derived from sample sizes substantially larger than randomized controlled trials. But is the information provided by an observational unit best used in the analysis phase? We propose the use of `pilot design,' in which observations are expended in the design phase of the study, and the post-treatment information from these observations is used to improve study design. In modern observational studies, which are data rich but control poor, pilot designs can be used to gain information about the structure of post-treatment variation. This information can then be used to improve instrumental variable designs, propensity score matching, doubly-robust estimation, and other observational study designs. We illustrate one version of a pilot design, which aims to reduce within-set heterogeneity and improve performance in sensitivity analyses. This version of a pilot design expends observational units during the design phase to fit a prognostic model, avoiding concerns of overfitting. Additionally, it enables the construction of `Assignment-Control ({AC}) plots,' which visualize the relationship between propensity and prognostic scores. We first show some examples of these plots, then we demonstrate in a simulation setting how this alternative use of the observations can lead to gains in terms of both treatment effect estimation and sensitivity analyses of unobserved confounding.},

However, outstanding critiques of the statistical properties of propensity score matching have cast doubt on the statistical efficiency of this technique, and the poor scalability of optimal matching to large data sets makes this approach inconvenient if not infeasible for sample sizes that are increasingly commonplace in modern observational data. The stratamatch package provides implementation support and diagnostics for ‘stratified matching designs,’ an approach that addresses both of these issues with optimal propensity score matching for large-sample observational studies. First, stratifying the data enables more computationally efficient matching of large data sets. Second, stratamatch implements a ‘pilot design’ approach in order to stratify by a prognostic score, which may increase the precision of the effect estimate and increase power in sensitivity analyses of unmeasured confounding.},

	abstract = {We show that propensity score matching ({PSM}), an enormously popular method of preprocessing data for causal inference, often accomplishes the opposite of its intended goal—thus increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. The weakness of {PSM} comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. {PSM} is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, {PSM} approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace {PSM} with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive uses.},

	abstract = {In the matched analysis of an observational study, confounding on covariates X is addressed by comparing members of a distinguished group (Z = 1) to controls (Z = 0) only when they belong to the same matched set. The better matchings, therefore, are those whose matched sets exhibit both dispersion in Z and uniformity in X. For dispersion in Z, pair matching is best, creating matched sets that are equally balanced between the groups; but actual data place limits, often severe limits, on matched pairs' uniformity in X. At the other extreme is full matching, the matched sets of which are as uniform in X as can be, while often so poorly dispersed in Z as to sacrifice efficiency.This article presents an algorithm for exploring the intermediate territory. Given requirements on matched sets' uniformity in X and dispersion in Z, the algorithm first decides the requirements' feasibility. In feasible cases, it furnishes a match that is optimal for X-uniformity among matches with Z-dispersion as stipulated. To illustrate, we describe the algorithm's use in a study comparing womens' to mens' working conditions; and we compare our method to a commonly used alternative, greedy matching, which is neither optimal nor as flexible but is algorithmically much simpler. The comparison finds meaningful advantages, in terms of both bias and efficiency, for our more studied approach.},

How do readers know that publications are not merely demonstrations that it is
              possible
              to find a specification that fits the author's favorite hypothesis? And how do we evaluate or even define statistical properties like unbiasedness or mean squared error when no unique model or estimator even exists? Matching methods, which offer the promise of causal inference with fewer assumptions, constitute one possible way forward, but crucial results in this fast-growing methodological literature are often grossly misinterpreted. We explain how to avoid these misinterpretations and propose a unified approach that makes it possible for researchers to preprocess data with matching (such as with the easy-to-use software we offer) and then to apply the best parametric techniques they would have used anyway. This procedure makes parametric models produce more accurate and considerably less model-dependent causal inferences.},

	abstract = {In a study comparing the effects of two treatments, the propensity score is the probability of assignment to one treatment conditional on a subject's measured baseline covariates. Propensity-score matching is increasingly being used to estimate the effects of exposures using observational data. In the most common implementation of propensity-score matching, pairs of treated and untreated subjects are formed whose propensity scores differ by at most a pre-specified amount (the caliper width). There has been a little research into the optimal caliper width. We conducted an extensive series of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the optimal caliper width for estimating differences in means (for continuous outcomes) and risk differences (for binary outcomes). When estimating differences in means or risk differences, we recommend that researchers match on the logit of the propensity score using calipers of width equal to 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score. When at least some of the covariates were continuous, then either this value, or one close to it, minimized the mean square error of the resultant estimated treatment effect. It also eliminated at least 98\% of the bias in the crude estimator, and it resulted in confidence intervals with approximately the correct coverage rates. Furthermore, the empirical type I error rate was approximately correct. When all of the covariates were binary, then the choice of caliper width had a much smaller impact on the performance of estimation of risk differences and differences in means.

Full matching makes use of all individuals in the data by forming a series of matched sets in which each set has either 1 treated individual and multiple comparison individuals or 1 comparison individual and multiple treated individuals.

Although treatment regimes need not be binary in practice, the propensity score methods are generally confined to binary treatment scenarios. Two possible exceptions have been suggested for ordinal and categorical treatments. In this article we develop theory and methods that encompass all of these techniques and widen their applicability by allowing for arbitrary treatment regimes.

	abstract = {Under the assumption of no unmeasured confounders, a large literature exists on methods that can be used to estimating average treatment effects ({ATE}) from observational data and that spans regression models, propensity score adjustments using stratification, weighting or regression and even the combination of both as in doubly-robust estimators. However, comparison of these alternative methods is sparse in the context of data generated via non-linear models where treatment effects are heterogeneous, such as is in the case of healthcare cost data. In this paper, we compare the performance of alternative regression and propensity score-based estimators in estimating average treatment effects on outcomes that are generated via non-linear models. Using simulations, we find that in moderate size samples (n= 5000), balancing on estimated propensity scores balances the covariate means across treatment arms but fails to balance higher-order moments and covariances amongst covariates, raising concern about its use in non-linear outcomes generating mechanisms. We also find that besides inverse-probability weighting ({IPW}) with propensity scores, no one estimator is consistent under all data generating mechanisms. The {IPW} estimator is itself prone to inconsistency due to misspecification of the model for estimating propensity scores. Even when it is consistent, the {IPW} estimator is usually extremely inefficient. Thus care should be taken before naively applying any one estimator to estimate {ATE} in these data. We develop a recommendation for an algorithm which may help applied researchers to arrive at the optimal estimator. We illustrate the application of this algorithm and also the performance of alternative methods in a cost dataset on breast cancer treatment.},

Subject to this restriction we maximize the sum of the weights of the edges in M . We prove that the b-Suitor algorithm computes the same b-Matching as the one obtained by the greedy algorithm for the problem. We implement the algorithm on serial and shared-memory parallel processors, and compare its performance against a collection of approximation algorithms that have been proposed earlier. Our results show that the b-Suitor algorithm outperforms the Greedy and Locally Dominant edge algorithms by one to two orders of magnitude on a serial processor. The b-Suitor algorithm has a high degree of concurrency, and it scales well up to 240 threads on a shared memory multiprocessor. The b-Suitor algorithm outperforms the Locally Dominant edge algorithm by a factor of fourteen on 16 cores of an Intel Xeon multiprocessor.},

This package implements the Dynamic Almost Matching Exactly ({DAME}) and Fast Large-Scale Almost Matching Exactly ({FLAME}) algorithms, which match treatment and control units on subsets of the covariates. The resulting matched groups are interpretable, because the matches are made on covariates (rather than, for instance, propensity scores), and high-quality, because machine learning is used to determine which covariates are important to match on. {DAME} solves an optimization problem that matches units on as many covariates as possible, prioritizing matches on important covariates. {FLAME} approximates the solution found by {DAME} via a much faster backward feature selection procedure. The package provides several adjustable parameters to adapt the algorithms to specific applications, and can calculate treatment effects after matching. Descriptions of these parameters, details on estimating treatment effects, and further examples, can be found in the documentation at https://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/{DAME}-{FLAME}-Python-Package/},

	abstract = {We aim to create the highest possible quality of treatment-control matches for categorical data in the potential outcomes framework. Matching methods are heavily used in the social sciences due to their interpretability, but most matching methods do not pass basic sanity checks: they fail when irrelevant variables are introduced, and tend to be either computationally slow or produce low-quality matches. The method proposed in this work aims to match units on a weighted Hamming distance, taking into account the relative importance of the covariates; the algorithm aims to match units on as many relevant variables as possible. To do this, the algorithm creates a hierarchy of covariate combinations on which to match (similar to downward closure), in the process solving an optimization problem for each unit in order to construct the optimal matches. The algorithm uses a single dynamic program to solve all of the optimization problems simultaneously. Notable advantages of our method over existing matching procedures are its high-quality matches, versatility in handling different data distributions that may have irrelevant variables, and ability to handle missing data by matching on as many available covariates as possible.},

	abstract = {A classical problem in causal inference is that of matching, where treatment units need to be matched to control units based on covariate information. In this work, we propose a method that computes high quality almost-exact matches for high-dimensional categorical datasets. This method, called {FLAME} (Fast Large-scale Almost Matching Exactly), learns a distance metric for matching using a hold-out training data set. In order to perform matching efficiently for large datasets, {FLAME} leverages techniques that are natural for query processing in the area of database management, and two implementations of {FLAME} are provided: the first uses {SQL} queries and the second uses bit-vector techniques. The algorithm starts by constructing matches of the highest quality (exact matches on all covariates), and successively eliminates variables in order to match exactly on as many variables as possible, while still maintaining interpretable high-quality matches and balance between treatment and control groups. We leverage these high quality matches to estimate conditional average treatment effects ({CATEs}). Our experiments show that {FLAME} scales to huge datasets with millions of observations where existing state-of-the-art methods fail, and that it achieves significantly better performance than other matching methods.},

In this paper we propose the same idea of intervention studies and the use of three methods for a health promotion research control group selection: Propensity score, Mahalanobis’ distance and Mahalanobis within Propensity Calipers. In the original project, “Health and Local Development: a progress review towards the millennium goals with relation to health in the Brazilian cities which develop social agendas”, cities with social agendas from Brazil were matched separately by state. In the state of Paraná there are 397 cities. Of these, 34 presented social agendas implemented and active since, at least, 2004. Five variables measured in 2000 were considered for the matching: population size, human development index of income, human development index of education, percentage of literacy and vaccine coverage. As a result, among these three methods, the Mahalanobis by itself was considered the less efficient. In conclusion, the propensity, which is a very simple linear score, presented very good matched sample. However, the Mahalanobis within Calipers was the method that provided the best result.},

	abstract = {The propensity score is a subject's probability of treatment, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Conditional on the true propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of observed baseline covariates. Propensity-score matching is a popular method of using the propensity score in the medical literature. Using this approach, matched sets of treated and untreated subjects with similar values of the propensity score are formed. Inferences about treatment effect made using propensity-score matching are valid only if, in the matched sample, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of measured baseline covariates. In this paper we discuss the following methods for assessing whether the propensity score model has been correctly specified: comparing means and prevalences of baseline characteristics using standardized differences; ratios comparing the variance of continuous covariates between treated and untreated subjects; comparison of higher order moments and interactions; five-number summaries; and graphical methods such as quantile-quantile plots, side-by-side boxplots, and non-parametric density plots for comparing the distribution of baseline covariates between treatment groups. We describe methods to determine the sampling distribution of the standardized difference when the true standardized difference is equal to zero, thereby allowing one to determine the range of standardized differences that are plausible with the propensity score model having been correctly specified. We highlight the limitations of some previously used methods for assessing the adequacy of the specification of the propensity-score model. In particular, methods based on comparing the distribution of the estimated propensity score between treated and untreated subjects are uninformative.},
